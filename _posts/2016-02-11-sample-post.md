title: Ruslan's first blog post!

Initially I was thinking of using a CMS (Wordpress) for my blog, but then I wanted to start with something minimalistic and fast. This is how I decided to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) text-to-HTML converter. For hosting I am using the Github. It is very easy and convinient to setup Jekyll on Github. Just clone one of the many Jekyll themes change the 'gitbub_username.github.io' and your blog is good to go!
Another cool feature of Jekyll is that it is neatly integrated with [Katex](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX), which is a fast TeX math .js library. Here are some the renderings of this neat library.

Mathemathical formula example:

$$
\frac{1}{\Bigl(\sqrt{\phi \sqrt{5}}-\phi\Bigr) e^{\frac25 \pi}} = 1+\frac{e^{-2\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-4\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-6\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-8\pi}} {1+\cdots} } } }
$$

Another mathmematical formula example:  

$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty\hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}\,d\xi
$$
