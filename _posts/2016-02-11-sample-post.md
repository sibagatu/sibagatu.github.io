title: Ruslan's first blog post!
---
Initially I was thinking of using a CMS (Wordpress) for my blog, but then I wanted to start with something minimalistic and fast. This is how I decided to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) text-to-HTML converter. For hosting I am using the Github. It is very easy and convinient to setup Jekyll on Github. Just clone one of the many Jekyll themes change the 'gitbub_username.github.io' and your blog is good to go!
Math example:

$$
\frac{1}{\Bigl(\sqrt{\phi \sqrt{5}}-\phi\Bigr) e^{\frac25 \pi}} = 1+\frac{e^{-2\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-4\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-6\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-8\pi}} {1+\cdots} } } }
$$
