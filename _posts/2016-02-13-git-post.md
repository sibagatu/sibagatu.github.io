Here is quick primer on how to use the Git shell in Windows:

1. Launch Git Shell on your local machine
2. Navigate to your local repo folder via `cd` command.
3. Type `git remote -v` to get a list of origins from the github online.
4. If you have edited code at online Github and need to update local copies typ:
   `git fetch --all`
   `git reset --hard origin/master`
    This will sync local copies with the the online image.
5. To create a file with non-standard file extension (ex. *.md) on Windows use command 
   `touch file_name.md`
7. The command `git status` shows which files were added, removed or updated otherwise       locally
8. Use `git add .` for all files or `git add file_name` for specific files to be position       for commiting
9. To commit use `git commit -m "added new post on Git shell usage"`
10. To push the changes to repo use `git push origin master` which is pushing the master    branch to the origin remote
