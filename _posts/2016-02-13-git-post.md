title: Useful Git commands

Here is a quick primer on how to use the Git shell in Windows:

1. Launch Git Shell on your local machine.
2. Navigate to your local repo folder via `cd` command.
3. Type `git remote -v` to get a list of origins from the github online.
4. If you have edited code at online Github and need to update local copies type:  
   `git fetch --all`  
   `git reset --hard origin/master`  
    This will sync local copies with the the online image.
5. To create a file with non-standard file extension (ex. *.md) on Windows use command 
   `touch file_name.md`
6. The command `git status` shows which files were added, removed or updated otherwise locally.
7. Use `git add .` for all files or `git add file_name` for specific files to be positioned for commiting.
8. To commit use `git commit -m "added new post on Git shell usage"`
9. To push the changes to repo use `git push origin master` , which is pushing the master branch to the origin remote.
